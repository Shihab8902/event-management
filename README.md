- ### Modern and easy to use navigate UI
Our application uses react and react router to ensure a better and modern website experience. We also use tailwind css which helps us to create a good looking and modern website layout. We also use various react packages to provide user a good feedback when a action is done. We use react single page architecture to navigate to different pages which gives a faster and responsive user experience.

- ### Email and password based authentication
We use firebase to create a email password based authentication system. User can login with their email and password as well as register their account.We also implement password validation system to ensure a secure password for the user.We are using firebase user profile update method to get the name and photo from the user which will help the user to identify which user is logged in currently.

- ### Selected event display
We implemented a private routing system which is active only when the user logged in. We use this routing system to show the client all the events they booked. It will help the client to monitor the event schedule and pricing everything in one place. Client can also view the details of the booked event directly from the route. We also implement event booking duplication detection system to prevent to client to book same event at same schedule twice accidentally.
